# React Router Dom Link Component Error
This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `Link` component from `react-router-dom`.  The error arises from using `Link` outside of a component that is properly connected to the router's context.  This often leads to the application failing to navigate or causing unexpected rendering behavior.

## Problem Description:
The provided `bug.js` file contains an example where the `Link` component is incorrectly used within the `Home` component, resulting in broken navigation.

## Solution:
The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the code, demonstrating proper usage of the `Link` component within the router's context.

## How to reproduce:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to run the application.
4. Observe the broken link behavior in the original buggy code.
5. Compare to the corrected behavior in the solution file.
